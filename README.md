- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProjectErostribe (Paidamoyo-Janet Azehko) aka "MYLES." I am founder/Creative Director of Project Erostribe.
- 👀 I’m interested in circus, fashion, and tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and PHP in order to follow my dreams and get a job as a Web Developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the following projects:
      - an app for nonverbal people with autism
      - a digital circus production by circus performers who can code.
